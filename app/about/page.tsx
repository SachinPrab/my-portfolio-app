        Hi! I'm Sachin Prabhakar - 
        <br className="hidden sm:inline" />
         a passionate and curious developer on a journey to master full-stack web development.
      </h1>

      <p className="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed text-justify sm:text-left">
        I'm currently pursuing an online MCA at Jain University with a specialization in Full Stack Development.
        <br />
        <br />
        I've been actively learning and building projects using modern technologies like React, Redux, TypeScript,
        Tailwind CSS, Node.js, MongoDB, and more. I recently created a fully functional bulletin board app using Redux Toolkit
        and continue to deepen my understanding of the frontend/backend ecosystem every day.
        <br />
        <br />
        What drives me is a constant desire to improve, build real-world applications, and solve problems creatively. I believe
        in learning by doing â€” and I'm not afraid to take on challenges, even when I don't know all the answers (yet).
        <br />
        <br />
        Outside of coding, I enjoy music, languages, and thinking about how tech can make a difference in everyday life.
        <br />
        <br />
        I'm always looking forward to collaborating with others, learning from new experiences, and contributing to meaningful projects.
        <br />
        <br />
        Thanks for visiting!
